Terpenome is defined as all terpenoid-derived molecules (including the terpenoids, steroids and their derivatives) and enzymes involved in their biosynthesis. <b>TeroKit</b> (http://terokit.qmclab.com/) is a webserver-based multi-scale toolkit conducive to the research of terpenome. It contains databases with annotated data of more than 180,000 terpenoid molecules (<b>TeroMOL</b>) and 13,000 enzymes (<b>TeroENZ</b>), which are further integrated into the terpenome reaction network (<b>TeroMAP</b>).
